# **....Where do I even start?**

Around 6 Months ago, I decided to quit my full-time job at Snapchat.
At the time I have been binge watching all of YCombinator's youtube videos and I was convinced that I was wasting my life. So, like any other sane person, I decided to quit my job without any concrete plan.

In the beginning, it was rough. I met some dudes on YCombinator's cofounder matching program and we tried to work together on a few ideas.  
However, as we all know, finding randoms on the internet to work with _might_ not be the best idea. After 1 month of working together, we decided to part ways.

**Lesson 1: Date in Person.**

I met my current cofounders at a local startup event in Toronto, this time, there was way more chemistry.
We decided to work together part-time at first on ideas in the sales vertical, (probably a story for a later time).
When I was meeting cofounders online, it was way harder to sus out
